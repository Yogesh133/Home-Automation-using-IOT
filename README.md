# Home-Automation-using-IOT

About the Project

The aim is to create a home automation system that performs all basic functions of a virtual assistant like telling the time, date, temperature and also controlling the electrical appliances that it is connected to. The entire system is aimed to be mobile operated. The system will take the help of certain sensors to provide automation to certain appliances. 
The main objective that has to be kept in mind for this work is that it is developed for making everyday life of a user easy. Getting things done without actually having to make an effort to do it is the main motto. Apart from this, the system also aims to provide for efficient utilization of electricity.

Software Used

The software we used in our project for home automation are listed below:
Arduino IDE - The Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or Arduino Software (IDE) - contains a text editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. It connects to the Arduino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them.
PICsimLab - PICSimLab is a realtime emulator of development boards with integrated MPLABX/avr-gdb debugger. PICSimLab supports some picsim microcontrollers and some simavr microcontrollers. PICSimLab have integration with MPLABX/Arduino IDE for programming the boards microcontrollers. 
Null Emulator -  The Null-modem emulator is an open source kernel-mode virtual serial port driver for Windows, available freely under GPL license. The Null-modem emulator allows you to create an unlimited number of virtual COM port pairs and use any pair to connect one COM port based application to another.
Blynk App - Blynk App - allows to you create amazing interfaces for your projects using various widgets we provide. Blynk Server - responsible for all the communications between the smartphone and hardware. You can use our Blynk Cloud or run your private Blynk server locally.
